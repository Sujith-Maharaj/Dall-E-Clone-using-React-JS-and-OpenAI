# Dall-E-Clone-using-React-JS-and-OpenAI API
The Doll-E clone can create realistic images based on the user's prompts. It uses OpenAI API to generate images. You have to put your prompt inside the input box and then OpenAI will do the rest for you. Also i have connected my mongoDB database to store my generated images to show that in my community which was created in this project..
